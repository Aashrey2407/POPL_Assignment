Questions 1 and 2 are Prolog exercises and Questions 3 and 4 are Racket(Scheme) exercises.

Prolog is based on the logic programming paradigm whereas Racket is based on the Functional Programming paradigm. This assignment was given to us in the course PoPL(Principles of Programming Languages) to give us a taste of various programming paradigms.

Q1:
This question we solve a riddle/puzzle with the help of prolog logic. We are given with some rules and based on those rules we have to make an assignment to each of the entities.

Q2:
This question we are asked to generate a mathematical equation from the given inputs with symbols in between them. This equation should be mathematically coherent.

Q3:
This question we make use of Racket to perform DFS(Depth-First-Search) which is a standard search algorithm used in graph data structures. Since DFS is a recursive algorithm we can implement this very easily in Racket.

Q4:
This question we are asked to insert an element in a nested list. The rules are that we insert the element at the start of every list. This insertion should be done at all levels of nesting.
Pure recursive implementation.
